## What is it about?
This website is a prototype of a webapp: its goal is to allow users to find quickly the songs they are looking for, and share them with others to sing together. Others can see the shared songs on their own devices the same as with a video projector. The rights to navigate freely or even to control the displayed songs can be given to some or all of them.
Obviously, control rights must be given thoughtfully... Intermediate rights will be developped in the future so that users can suggest songs that the controler has then to confirm or reject.
The goal of this webapp is not to be used instead of a videoprojector, which has the advantage that everyone looks up to. But for one does not have always a vidoprojector close by. Moreover, this webapp can be used with a videoprojector as a remote control on a mobile or a tablet.
