## What is it about?
This website is a prototype of a webapp: its goal is to allow users to quickly find the songs they are looking for, and share them with others to sing them together. The others can see the shared songs on their own devices like with a video projector. The rights to navigate freely or even to control the songs displayed can be granted to some or all of them.
Obviously, control rights must be granted thoughtfully... Intermediate rights will be developped in the future so that users can suggest songs that the controler has then to confirm or reject.
The goal of this webapp is not to be used instead of a videoprojector, which has the advantage that everybody look up. But one does not have everytime a vidoprojector close by. Moreover, this webapp can be used with a videoprojector as a remote control on a mobile or a tablet.
